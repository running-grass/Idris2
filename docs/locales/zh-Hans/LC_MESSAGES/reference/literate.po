"The unlit'n has been designed based such that we assume that we are parsing "
"markdown-like languages The unlit'n is performed by a Lexer that uses a "
"provided literate style to recognise code blocks and code lines. Anything "
"else is ignored. Idris2 also provides support for recognising both 'visible'"
" and 'invisible' code blocks using 'native features' of each literate style."
