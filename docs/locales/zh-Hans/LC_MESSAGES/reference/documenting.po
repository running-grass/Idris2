"Idris documentation comes in two major forms: comments, which exist for a "
"reader’s edification and are ignored by the compiler, and inline API "
"documentation, which the compiler parses and stores for future reference. To"
" consult the documentation for a declaration ``f``, write ``:doc f`` at the "
"REPL or use the appropriate command in your editor (``C-c C-d`` in Emacs, "
"``<LocalLeader>h`` in Vim)."

"Use comments to explain why code is written the way that it is. Idris’s "
"comment syntax is the same as that of Haskell: lines beginning with ``--`` "
"are comments, and regions bracketed by ``{-`` and ``-}`` are comments even "
"if they extend across multiple lines. These can be used to comment out lines"
" of code or provide simple documentation for the readers of Idris code."

"Idris also supports a comprehensive and rich inline syntax for Idris code to"
" be generated. This syntax also allows for named parameters and variables "
"within type signatures to be individually annotated using a syntax similar "
"to Javadoc parameter annotations."

"Documentation always comes before the declaration being documented. Inline "
"documentation applies to either top-level declarations or to constructors. "
"Documentation for specific arguments to constructors, type constructors, or "
"functions can be associated with these arguments using their names."

"The inline documentation for a declaration is an unbroken string of lines, "
"each of which begins with ``|||`` (three pipe symbols). The first paragraph "
"of the documentation is taken to be an overview, and in some contexts, only "
"this overview will be shown. After the documentation for the declaration as "
"a whole, it is possible to associate documentation with specific named "
"parameters, which can either be explicitly name or the results of converting"
" free variables to implicit parameters.  Annotations are the same as with "
"Javadoc annotations, that is for the named parameter ``(n : T)``, the "
"corresponding annotation is ``||| @ n Some description`` that is placed "
"before the declaration."

"Documentation is written in Markdown, though not all contexts will display "
"all possible formatting (for example, images are not displayed when viewing "
"documentation in the REPL, and only some terminals render italics "
"correctly). A comprehensive set of examples is given below."
