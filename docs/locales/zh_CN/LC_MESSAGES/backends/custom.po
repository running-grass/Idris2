"The way to extend Idris 2 with new backends is to use it as a library. "
"The module ``Idris.Driver`` exports the function ``mainWithCodegens``, "
"that takes a list of ``(String, Codegen)``, starting idris with these "
"codegens in addition to the built-in ones. The first codegen in the list "
"will be set as the default codegen."

"The code generator can assume that both ``tmpDir`` and ``outputDir`` "
"exist. ``tmpDir`` is intended for temporary files, while ``outputDir`` is"
" the location to put the desired output files. By default, ``tmpDir`` and"
" ``outputDir`` point to the same directory (``build/exec``). The "
"directories can be set from the package description (See Section :ref"
":`ref-sect-packages`) or via command line options (Listed in ``idris2 "
"--help``)."
