"Idris 2 is designed to support multiple code generators. The default "
"target is Chez Scheme, with Racket and Gambit code generators also "
"supported. However, the intention is, as with Idris 1, to support "
"multiple targets on multiple platforms, including e.g. JavaScript, JVM, "
".NET, and others yet to be invented. This makes the design of a foreign "
"function interface (FFI), which calls functions in other languages, a "
"little challenging, since ideally it will support all possible targets!"

"To this end, the Idris 2 FFI aims to be flexible and adaptable, while "
"still supporting most common requirements without too much need for "
"\"glue\" code in the foreign language."
