"Idris documentation comes in two major forms: comments, which exist for a"
" reader’s edification and are ignored by the compiler, and inline API "
"documentation, which the compiler parses and stores for future reference."
" To consult the documentation for a declaration ``f``, write ``:doc f`` "
"at the REPL or use the appropriate command in your editor (``C-c C-d`` in"
" Emacs, ``<LocalLeader>h`` in Vim)."

"Use comments to explain why code is written the way that it is. Idris’s "
"comment syntax is the same as that of Haskell: lines beginning with "
"``--`` are comments, and regions bracketed by ``{-`` and ``-}`` are "
"comments even if they extend across multiple lines. These can be used to "
"comment out lines of code or provide simple documentation for the readers"
" of Idris code."

"Idris also supports a comprehensive and rich inline syntax for Idris code"
" to be generated. This syntax also allows for named parameters and "
"variables within type signatures to be individually annotated using a "
"syntax similar to Javadoc parameter annotations."

"Documentation always comes before the declaration being documented. "
"Inline documentation applies to either top-level declarations or to "
"constructors. Documentation for specific arguments to constructors, type "
"constructors, or functions can be associated with these arguments using "
"their names."

"The inline documentation for a declaration is an unbroken string of "
"lines, each of which begins with ``|||`` (three pipe symbols). The first "
"paragraph of the documentation is taken to be an overview, and in some "
"contexts, only this overview will be shown. After the documentation for "
"the declaration as a whole, it is possible to associate documentation "
"with specific named parameters, which can either be explicitly name or "
"the results of converting free variables to implicit parameters.  "
"Annotations are the same as with Javadoc annotations, that is for the "
"named parameter ``(n : T)``, the corresponding annotation is ``||| @ n "
"Some description`` that is placed before the declaration."

"Documentation is written in Markdown, though not all contexts will "
"display all possible formatting (for example, images are not displayed "
"when viewing documentation in the REPL, and only some terminals render "
"italics correctly). A comprehensive set of examples is given below."
