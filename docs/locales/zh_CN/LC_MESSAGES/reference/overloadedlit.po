"The compiler provides directives for literals overloading, respectively "
"``%stringLit <fun>`` and ``%integerLit <fun>`` for string and integer "
"literals. During elaboration, the given function is applied to the "
"corresponding literal. In the Prelude these functions are set to "
"``fromString`` and ``fromInteger``."

"The interface ``FromString ty`` provides the ``fromString : String -> "
"ty`` function, while the ``Num ty`` interface provides the ``fromInteger "
": Integer -> ty`` function for all numerical types."

"Although the overloading of literals can be achieved by implementing the "
"interfaces described above, in principle only a function with the correct"
" signature and name is enough to achieve the desired behaviour. This can "
"be exploited to obtain more restrictive overloading such as converting "
"literals to ``Fin n`` values, where integer literals greater or equal to "
"n are not constructible values for the type. Additional implicit "
"arguments can be added to the function signature, in particular auto "
"implicit arguments for searching proofs. As an example, this is the "
"implementation of ``fromInteger``Â for ``Fin n``."

"The ``prf`` auto implicit is an automatically constructed proof (if "
"possible) that the literal is suitable for the ``Fin n`` type. The "
"restricted behaviour can be observed in the REPL, where the failure to "
"construct a valid proof is caught during the type-checking phase and not "
"at runtime:"
