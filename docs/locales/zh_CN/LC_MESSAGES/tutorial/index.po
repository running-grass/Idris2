"This is a crash course in Idris 2 (sort of a tutorial, but rather less "
"gentle I'm afraid!). It provides a brief introduction to programming in "
"the Idris Language. It covers the core language features, assuming some "
"experience with an existing functional programming language such as "
"Haskell or OCaml."
