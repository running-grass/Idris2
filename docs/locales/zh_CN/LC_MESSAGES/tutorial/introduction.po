"In conventional programming languages, there is a clear distinction "
"between *types* and *values*. For example, in `Haskell "
"<https://www.haskell.org>`_, the following are types, representing "
"integers, characters, lists of characters, and lists of any value "
"respectively:"

"In a language with *dependent types*, however, the distinction is less "
"clear. Dependent types allow types to “depend” on values — in other "
"words, types are a *first class* language construct and can be "
"manipulated like any other value. The standard example is the type of "
"lists of a given length [#fn1]_, ``Vect n a``, where ``a`` is the element"
" type and ``n`` is the length of the list and can be an arbitrary term."

"When types can contain values, and where those values describe "
"properties, for example the length of a list, the type of a function can "
"begin to describe its own properties. Take for example the concatenation "
"of two lists. This operation has the property that the resulting list's "
"length is the sum of the lengths of the two input lists. We can therefore"
" give the following type to the ``app`` function, which concatenates "
"vectors:"

"This tutorial introduces Idris, a general purpose functional programming "
"language with dependent types. The goal of the Idris project is to build "
"a dependently typed language suitable for verifiable general purpose "
"programming. To this end, Idris is a compiled language which aims to "
"generate efficient executable code. It also has a lightweight foreign "
"function interface which allows easy interaction with external libraries."

"This tutorial is intended as a brief introduction to the language, and is"
" aimed at readers already familiar with a functional language such as "
"`Haskell <https://www.haskell.org>`_ or `OCaml <https://ocaml.org>`_. In "
"particular, a certain amount of familiarity with Haskell syntax is "
"assumed, although most concepts will at least be explained briefly. The "
"reader is also assumed to have some interest in using dependent types for"
" writing and verifying software."

"Idris 2. These files are available with the Idris 2 distribution, so that"
" you can try them out easily. They can be found under ``samples``. It is,"
" however, strongly recommended that you type them in yourself, rather "
"than simply loading and reading them."
