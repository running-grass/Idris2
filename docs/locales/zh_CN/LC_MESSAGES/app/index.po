"Idris applications have ``main : IO ()`` as an entry point.  A type ``IO "
"a`` is a description of interactive actions which produce a value of type"
" ``a``. This is fine for primitives, but ``IO`` does not support "
"exceptions so we have to be explicit about how an operation handles "
"failure. Also, if we do want to support exceptions, we also want to "
"explain how exceptions and linearity (see Section :ref:`sect-"
"multiplicities`) interact."
