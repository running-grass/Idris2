"``Control.App`` is primarily intended to make it easier to manage the "
"common cases of applications with exceptions and state. We can throw and "
"catch exceptions listed in the list of errors (the ``es`` parameter to "
"``App``) and introduce new global state."

"We can use ``throw`` and ``catch`` for some exception type ``err`` as "

"Note the ``HasErr`` constraint on ``Exception``: this is one place where "
"it is notationally convenient that the ``auto`` implicit mechanism and "
"the interface resolution mechanism are identical in Idris 2. Finally, we "
"can introduce new exception types via ``handle``, which runs a block of "
"code which might throw, handling any exceptions:"

"These use an ``auto``-implicit to pass around a ``State`` with the "

"Note that the type tells us ``new`` runs the program with the state "
"exactly once. Rather than using ``State`` and ``Exception`` directly, "
"however, we typically use interfaces to constrain the operations which "
"are allowed in a list of errors. Internally, ``State`` is implemented via"
" an ``IORef``, primarily for performance reasons."
